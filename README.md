# The Technical Assessment

Ready to put your skills to the test and have some full-stack hacking fun? This assessment is like a day long solo sprint where you get to build a full stack JavaScript application using the skills and technologies you've worked with during the Junior phase. Expect to reinforce concepts and techniques you are familiar with and also to learn some new content.

## Message from your instructional team

This is it guys! It all comes down to today. We believe that you made a tremendous effort in the last 3 months and we are proud of your improvement.

Keep pushing, keep working hard, keep believing in yourself and eventually, your efforts will pay off.

We hope to see results that reflect the dedication you have put in.

Trust yourself, you know more than you think you do!

Good luck and make us proud! We believe in you!

## Before Starting

1. Confirm that all communication applications and tools are turned off, closed, put away
1. Clone this repo. Do not push your work any time during this assessment.

## Guidelines

You must manage your time effectively to complete this assessment. This assessment will be evaluated as if it was a coding challenge given to you as part of a job application process. Not only will the functionality of your code be important, but also, the professionalism with which you write it. Consider the style and organization of your code. Make frequent commits with informative and consistent commit messages. Be professional and informative with your comments.

Each directory contains a prompt with work for you to complete, with instructions defined in their own README.

## Available resources

The ultimate goal of this assessment is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your abilities as an engineer. Avoid anything that will obscure our ability and your ability to see your best efforts at work will undermine that goal.

- You **may not** use a scaffolding tool (e.g. Yeoman) or starter repos unless specifically allowed in a prompt's README
- You **may not** use any resources created at RBK by yourself, other students, or staff members
  - e.g. lectures, sprints, MVP, past assessments, side projects, mentor assignments, etc.
- You **may** only use online resources specifically allowed in a prompt's README
- You **may not** copy and paste from available online resources

## Submitting Your Work

At 5:00pm (or beforehand if you finish early):

 Make a final commit

- NOTE: This commit should only contain changes to these two files - no other changes are allowed

1. Push your code to your origin main.
2. Stop recording your screen and save your video file locally as `firstname-lastname-yyyymmdd`
3. The instructional team will provide you with a google drive where you can upload your recording if needed.


Best of luck
